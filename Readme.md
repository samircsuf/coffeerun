CPSC 473 - Web Front-End Engineering for Internet Applications

Assignment 5 - Spring 2017

Section 2 due March 6.  Section 1 due March 8.

In this assignment, you will lay the foundation for the CoffeeRun app and get started with the QUnit test framework.

Complete the following:

Work through Chapter 8 to create the DataStore and Truck modules.

As you work in the DevTools Console, keep in mind that you can recall previously executed code using the Up and Down arrow keys on the keyboard.

That said, it would be nice to have our test code for DataStore and Truck saved permanently.  Create a new page, tests.html, and a new script, scripts/tests.js, and configure them to use the QUnit test framework.

Convert the code in Figure 8.10 into QUnit tests for DataStore.  When a function returns a value, use appropriate assert methods to check its result.

What problem do you run into when you attempt to convert the code in Figure 8.32 into QUnit tests for Truck?  Document the problem in tests.js, and define additional methods in truck.js to allow Truck to be tested appropriately.

Push the contents of your coffeerun directory into a new public GitHub repository.
